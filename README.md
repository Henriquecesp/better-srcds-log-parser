### A better CS:GO Log Parser

A Typescript/Javascript library for reading Counter Strike: GO logs. 

More details to come. 

### Example types

See `warmod-types.json` and `srcds-types.json` for, respectively, the log entry types 
that Warmod will emit, and the log entry types that a vanilla CS:GO server will emit. 
Both can be enabled on a server at the same time.
