### A better srcds (CS:GO, TF2, etc) Log Parser

A Typescript/Javascript library for reading log files from 
Valve's Source Dedicated Server (srcds), including 
Counter Strike: GO, Counter Strike: Source, Team Fortress 2, 
and so on. 

Presently only the special events for CS:GO have been added
so TF2 will not actually work, but the rest will be added soon. 

More details to come. 

### Example types

See `warmod-types.json` and `srcds-types.json` for, respectively, the log entry types 
that Warmod will emit, and the log entry types that a vanilla CS:GO server will emit. 
Both can be enabled on a server at the same time.
